"""
This project is a test automation framework built using Cucumber and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It is structured to facilitate behavior-driven development (BDD) and maintainable test automation.

Framework Structure:
- features/: Contains Cucumber feature files written in Gherkin syntax, describing the test scenarios.
- step_definitions/: Houses the step definition files that map Gherkin steps to executable code.
- pages/: Implements the Page Object Model, encapsulating web page elements and actions for reusability.
- scripts/: Includes utility scripts for test execution, setup, and teardown.
- .env: Stores environment variables such as URLs, credentials, and configuration settings.
- reports/: Directory for generated test execution reports (e.g., HTML, JSON).

Setup Instructions:
1. Install dependencies:
    - Ensure Node.js is installed.
    - Run `npm install` to install required packages (Cucumber, WebDriver, etc.).
2. Configure environment:
    - Edit the `.env` file with appropriate values for your test environment.
3. Prepare browser drivers if needed (e.g., ChromeDriver).

Running Tests:
- Execute tests using the command: `npm test` or `npx cucumber-js`.
- Test results and reports will be generated in the `reports/` directory.

This framework enables scalable, readable, and maintainable automated testing by combining Cucumber's BDD approach with the modularity of the Page Object Model.
